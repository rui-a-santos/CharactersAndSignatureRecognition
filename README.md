# Characters and Signature Recognition

Developed models using KNN and CNN to predict written and handwritten letters which are extracted from an imported pdf.  Also built a model for identifying unique handwritten signatures using KNN. Developed using the EMNIST and OCR dataset, as well as my own handwritten signature dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this, you will need Python 3.0 on your machine. 

### Installing

After instalation and extraction of zip into a chosen directory, use the terminal command to run the desired file. HanwrittenLetters provides the models on handwritten letters using EMNIST dataset. PrintedLetters provides the model on Printed letters on a pdf using the OCR dataset. SignatureLetters provides the model for identifiying the handwritten signature. Extract_Letters and Sorting_Character provide functions used in the previous three files.

Once in the directory containing all files, an example of the python command to run the file would be:

```
python signatureLetters.py
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
